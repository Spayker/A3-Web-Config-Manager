# A3-Web-Config-Manager

Web config manager was born from an idea to influence a virtual world from a real one. The idea itself is not new originally
but its potential remains high. It happens so because new variations of gameplay can be invented that can bring 
a typical game on a new level.

The concept has one purpose: to prove a theory when real world data can change ingame experience of each player.
